As of December 30th, 2019, I...

## Current

* Still doing Data Structure and Algorithm problems
* Building [Munchbot](https://github.com/Munchbot-io/munchbot-node-js) project

## Future

I (still) need to do:

* Upgrade Thoughts -> Create a MVP product.
* Complete GitHub Commit Chart as a separate library.
* Update Liar Game - need to add Spy Mode.

I need to study:

* Data Structure & Algorithms - For fun and for competitions
* C++, Python
* TypeScript

There's also few (very) long-term goals that I want to do:

* Understand Low-level computer systems
* Build my own programming language (To teach Data Structure and Algorithm to kids)
* Robotics - build my things! My philosophy has always revolved with creating and making things.
* Languages (French, German, Japanese)
