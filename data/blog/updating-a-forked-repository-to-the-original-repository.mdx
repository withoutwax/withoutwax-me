1. Add remote with the original repository url - name it "upstream"

git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo/example.git 2. Fetch all the branches and content of remote upstream

git fetch upstream 3. Need to rewrite the master with upstream's master using git rebase

- Also need to make sure that you are on the master branch: git checkout master

git rebase upstream/master 4. Push the updates to local master (may need --force)

git push origin master
