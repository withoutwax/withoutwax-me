While there are many other hosting / publishing methods to host a website, one of my favorite is using GitHub Pages to host my project.

You can also read in more detail about deployment in React documentation.

GitHub Pages
Step 01: Update package.json
Add this code to package.json

"homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app"
It is important to know that we need to use the url generated with GitHub pages.

Step 02: Install dependency: gh-pages & add deploy scripts in package.json
While the React documentation uses npm, you could also use yarn to run the deployment.

yarn add gh-pages
After installing the dependencies, you also need to update the package.json:

"scripts": { "predeploy": "npm run build", "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",}
Note that the predeploy script will run automatically before deploy script is run.

Step 03: Run yarn deploy
You are ready. Simply run:

yarn deploy
