Smart Mirror is a simple simulation where it captures a user's face and allows other person to mask the captured face on his/her's face.

The idea was originally developed from a generic smart mirror, where instead of reflecting the user with holographic diagram which aides the user this mirror explores with the concept of manipulating the someone else's face and implementing onto the other.
