        During my Sophomore year, there was an opening for a class called
        'Object Oriented Programming.' I was curious to know what the class was
        and took it - and it changed my life. Since then, I've been coding and
        diving deeper into the world of programming. Now I am here!

I often wear many hats, using different tech stacks, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, React, etc...
