        During my Sophomore year, there was an opening for a class called
        'Object Oriented Programming.' I was curious to know what the class was
        and took it - and it changed my life. Since then, I've been coding and
        diving deeper into the world of programming. Now I am here!
      question: "How did you start \U0001F4BB coding?"
    - answer: "Currently, I am working as a Web Developer in Legion Collective, a design agency based in Chicago. I am currently into Web Technology \U0001F310 using JavaScript, React and TypeScript. Occasionally, I am also doing some work in PHP, Python and C++. At home, I normally work on my side projects \U0001F579, build dev tools \U0001F6E0 or fun games \U0001F47E"
      question: What are you currently doing?
    - answer: "I have special love for minimalism, technology and the nature \U0001F331 Let's save the nature and make the \U0001F30E a better place. Plus, I love quotes too."
