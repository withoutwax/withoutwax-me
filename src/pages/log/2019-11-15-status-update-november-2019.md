As of November 15th, 2019, I...

## Current

* Finished the gig with Pixelic.io
* Still learning TypeScript
* Practicing Data Structure and Algorithm problems (for fun purposes)
* Created a tracking website to help my church friends to monitor QTs

## Future

I (still) need to do:

* Upgrade Log -> Create a MVP product.
* Complete [GitHub Commit Chart](https://github.com/withoutwax/Commit-Chart-Generator) as a separate library.
* Update [Liar Game](https://github.com/withoutwax/Liar-Game) - need to add Spy Mode.

I need to study:

* Data Structure & Algorithms - For fun and for competitions
* C++, Python (Recap)
* TypeScript

There's also few (very) long-term goals that I want to do:

* Understand Low-level computer systems
* Build my own programming language (To teach Data Structure and Algorithm to kids)
* Robotics - build my things! My philosophy has always revolved with creating and making things.
* Languages (French, German, Japanese)
