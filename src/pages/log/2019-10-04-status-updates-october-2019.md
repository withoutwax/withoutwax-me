This is a new posts that I am thinking of doing every months, where I share what is currently happening with my life (or what had happened). You can think of this as a simple journal.

Just a simple status updates which I would like to keep a record of.

So, as of October 4th, 2019, I... 

## Current

* Started a new gig with [Pixelic.io](https://www.pixelic.io).
* Started learning TypeScript.



## Future

I need to do:

* Upgrade Log -> Create a MVP product.
* Complete [GitHub Commit Chart](https://github.com/withoutwax/Commit-Chart-Generator) as a separate library.
* Update [Liar Games](https://github.com/withoutwax/Liar-Game) - need to add Spy Mode.

I need to study:

* Data Structure & Algorithms - For fun and for competitions
* C++, Python (Recap)
* TypeScript (with React and Redux)

There's also few (very) long-term goals that I want to do:
* Understand Low-level computer systems
* Build my own programming language
* Robotics - build my things! _My philosophy has always revolved with creating and making things._
* Languages (French, German, Japanese)
